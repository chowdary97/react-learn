Episode-6 -> Explore the world
==================================

Architecutes
------------------------
1. Monolith (Combining all services like Ui, Api, Auth, Db at one place )
2. Microservice (Every service (ui,api,notifications,auth, database etc.) is a different service is not included in the same project)
   |
   -> React project is a ui servie in Microservice.
   -> Each service is host with different ports in server that will be accesed with ip address and that particular port.



Api Integration
---------------------
This api integration can be done in two ways.
load page -> call api -> Render Response
load page -> Render Skeleton -> Api -> ReRender (Better ux)


UseEffect Hook
--------------------
It takes two arguments
useEffect(()=>{},[])   // first argument is callback function and second argument is dependency array.
* Call back function is called when render cycle is finished.
* When we try to make api request to swiggy servers we get cors error, to bypass we the cors we need to use extension from web(Access-control-allow-origin)


Optional Chaining
------------------------
checking the data from an object
 
 ex: data?.list[0]?.cards


 Shimmer Ui
 -------------------
 Shimmer ui is fake ui until we get response from api we show skeleton (fake cards in ui).




const [user,setUser]=useState({})

eventhough user is defined with constant that can be updated by setUser which is not a js priciple,
but when we set setUser this Reconciliation will re run the entire component and assign it as new varibale
