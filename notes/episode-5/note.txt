=========================
Everything that can be done with react is done with html,css and javascript.
But we use libraries(react,angular etc) makes developer life easier.
  These make coding fast 
  optimizes performance.

* We create a 'src' folder to keep all the source code as for the convention.
* There is no proper approach to structure the folders in react app. It is not necessary to this, but to make developer life easy we need to structure.
* Eventhoug the folder are structured in a proper way, the bundler(parcel, webpack) they optimize the code and move the code into single file.


Folder structure
--------------------
src
  |
  components(this contains all the components)
  |
  utils(this contains all the utils like links, images etc.)
  |
  constants(all the global links are kept in constants)
  |

Utils
--------------
All the common links that are available for our application should be kept in utils folder



export
-----------------
export can be done in two ways
1. default 
     export default anyname

2. named export
     export const LOGO_URL = 'https://iamge.com/123"




Filtering is done for restaurants using filter.

React Hooks
-----------------------
* React hook is normal js function which is given by react.
* To sync between variable and ui in react we need to use useState hook, whenever there is a change in the useState hook that will render the ui

State variable
------------------
this useState variable makes sync with the ui.
this is known as render.
whenever state variable updates react rerender the component.
the logic of updating ui is rerendering.

Reconciliation
-------------------
The Algorithm which uses diff one to another to determine which parts need to be changed.
Reconciliation is the process of effecentily updating the DOM whenever there is change in the props or state.
this uses Diff Algorithm.


* React uses Reconciliation Algorithm which is also known as React Fibre.
  ex:
     if a container have 10 cards  => that filters to 3 cards

* Virtual DOM is representation of Actual DOM or Real DOM.
* Virtual DOM is basically object. that contains all the React elements.
* Diff Algo => It finds the difference between the updated Virtual DOM and Previous Virtual DOM and updates the Real DOM.
* Finding out the difference between two html codes is slower than finding the difference between the javascript objects.

Array Destructuring
-----------------------
const [data,setData] = useState();

let arr = useState();
const [data,setData] = arr;

const data = arr[0];
const setData = arr[1];

all these are same this is just Destructuring of array.
