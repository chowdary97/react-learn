Optimization
================================
Optimization is the way of render the react application as soon as possible with the possible data.
we have so many techniques to optimize
 1. Reconsilication -> Which refers to diff algo where the difference between dom is calculated and updating the new dom based on old dom without affetcing the not changed elements
 2. React Router -> while navigating between the routes we use some common components in entire application like head, footer those should not be rerender everytime application refreshed
                    for that we use "LINK" component in react-router-dom to refresh only the particular component without refreshing the entire component.
