========================
Higher Order Component(HOC)
-----------------------------
It is a function that takes a Component and returns a Component.
-> It takes an existing Component and adds some code and returns it.
-> ex: in swiggy app it shows some cards as promoted.
       all cards are similars so it takes a card component and adds promoted and enhances it and return that enhanced card
-> without affecting other functionality in cards we use this hoc to enhance the component.


Controlled & UnControlled Components
------------------------------------------
to control the components we need to lift up the state
lefting up the state of a variable from child to parent.




React chrome extension
----------------------------------




Props Drilling
-----------------------------
passing props from parent to the indepth child is props drilling.


React Context
----------------------
To avoid props drilling we need to react Context
this context in react makes the data available globally without props drilling we can access the data directly.

what kind of data we can store in context 
|
-> LoggedIn user
-> maintaining theme 
-> maintaining cart

we have to use only two things
createContext
useContext

create a context using createContext
   ex: import { createContext } from "react";

        const UserContext = createContext({
            loggedInUser: "Thimma Chowdary"
        })
        export default UserContext;
use this UserContext by using useContext and import 
   ex: const user = useContext(UserContext);

* In Classbased compnents we use UserContext.Consumer to access the global data
* We can use UserContext.Consumer can be used any time and anywhere

Difference b/w Context and Redux
  Redux is a statement management library which is not in react;
