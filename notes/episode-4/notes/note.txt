-----------------
Crating any application we need to have proper plan.

creating a swiggy application.

we taled about creating a swiggy application
we talked about creating components like restrauntcard
passing dynamic data to the card as props
talked about destructring of props


* Added Json Viewer to chrome extension

Config Driven UI
----------------------------
Front UI is driven by config from backend
* data is the config
* based on the data from we show UI
  ex: data is different for different locations
      for suppose if theere is carousal data we show carousal banner and data init otherwise we dont't show the carousal banner
* When we build large applications we put images in cdn ex: cloudinary


* Good practice for coding is destructre the object in child component 

KEYS
----------------
* Keys are very important when iterate over array in react
* to optimize the application we need to put key in a list 
* if we don't use key it will remove entire list from dom and rerenders the list.
* instead of rerendring entire list to optimize the application we just need to rerenders the elements only that have data changed or new item came in.

* for good practive don't use index as key it is the last priority to use index as key.
